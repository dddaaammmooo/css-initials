## Usage

### vanilla css

Copy `index.css` file from the repo into your project as `./css/initize.css` (actual path is up to you).

```css
/**
 * on the very top of your ./styles/main.css
 */
 @import './css/initize.css';
.initize {
  font-family: Arial, "sans-serif";
  quotes: "“" "”" "‘" "’";
  color: black;
  outline-color: black;
}

/* some styles here */

.button {
  /* …more styles here…*/
}
```

In HTML, just add initize class in the start

```html
<button class="initize button">Submit</button>
```

### css-modules

```css
/**
 * once in your project, specify your
 * ./src/components/app-initize/index.css
 */
.app-initize {
  composes: initize from 'initize/index.css';

  font-family: Arial, "sans-serif";
  quotes: "“" "”" "‘" "’";
  color: black;
  outline-color: black;
}

/**
 *  anywhere after in your components
 *  ./src/components/button/index.css
 */
.button {
  composes: app-initize from './app-initize.css';
  /* …more styles here…*/
}

```

### css-in-js

#### jss

```js
import initize from 'initize';
import jss from 'jss';
import preset from 'jss-preset-default';

jss.setup(preset());

const appInitize = Object.assign({}, initize, {
  fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
  quotes: '"“" "”" "‘" "’"',
  color: 'black',
  outlineColor: 'black',
})

const initizeSheet = jss.createStyleSheet({ appInitize }).attach();

const {classes} = jss.createStyleSheet({
  button: {
    composes: initizeSheet.classes.appInitize,
    background: 'blue',
  }
}).attach();

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <button class="${classes.button}">Button</button>
`;

```

#### styled-components

```js
// once in your project, specify your
// ./src/components/app-initize/index.js
import initize from 'initize';
const toCSS = obj => Object.keys(obj).map(key => `${key}: ${obj[key]};`).join('\n');

export default `
  ${toCSS(initize)}
  font-family: Arial, 'sans-serif';
  quotes: "“" "”" "‘" "’";
  color: black;
  outline-color: black;
`;

// anywhere after in your components
// ./src/components/button/index.js
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import appInitize from '../app-initize';

const Button = styled.button`
  ${appInitize}
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 5px;
  /* …more styles here…*/
`;

export default Button;
```

## FAQ

—**What is wrong with the usual `all: initial`?**  
—It's [not supported in IE, Edge, Mobile android][IEEDGE].

—**What do you mean by cross-browser?**  
—I took all properties and combined 'em with their initial values, so it works in every browser, because its essentially `all: initial`, but expanded.

—**What do you mean by thoughtful?**  
—There are several caveats about `all: initial` as it is now, and I have built this package with those caveats in mind.

—**What are the caveats?**  
— 1) Initial values of `font-family`, `quotes` and `color` depend on the browser  
— 2) 14 properties depend on `currentColor`, which is a reference to the `color` property, which varies from browser to browser (hence prev point), and these properties are: `-webkit-border-before-color`, `-webkit-text-fill-color`, `-webkit-text-stroke-color`, `border-block-end-color`, `border-block-start-color`, `border-bottom-color`, `border-inline-end-color`, `border-inline-start-color`, `border-left-color`, `border-right-color`, `border-top-color`, `column-rule-color`, `text-decoration-color`, `text-emphasis-color`.  
— 3) Initial value of `outline-color` is either `invert` if the browser supports it, or `currentColor` otherwise.

—**Is this all?**  
—It depends. If you want military grade CSS cascade defense, then no, otherwise hold on. Thing is that according to the spec, `all: initial` doesn't apply initial values to `unicode-bidi` and `direction`.

—**I've never heard of `unicode-bidi`.**  
—To be honest, me neither. It is quite complicated and I don't know why one would need it. But as long as this property is not inherited it's safe to leave it untouched.

—**What's up with `direction`?**  
—Good question. Firstly, `direction` deals with the `ltr/rtl` problem. Secondly, it is inheritable, so it will definitely affect your components. It can have a negative impact on your components' isolation, so it also doesn't make sense to allow your components to inherit `direction` from the outside world. Your components should be optimised for `ltr` anyway, and `direction: rtl` wont make 'em automatically look good in arabic or hebrew. To fix `ltr/rtl` problem properly you would need a solution like [rtlcss][], because you not only want to change direction, but you want to adjust `text-align`, `margin`, `padding`, `border-width`, etc.

—**Is this all?**  
—yes, thanks for your attention.
